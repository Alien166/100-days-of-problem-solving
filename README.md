# 100 Days of Code and Problem Solving

Welcome to my 100 days of code and problem-solving journey! In this repository, I will be documenting my progress as I commit to coding and solving problems every day for the next 100 days.

## Motivation

The purpose of this challenge is to enhance my coding skills, improve problem-solving abilities, and build a consistent coding habit. By dedicating time every day to code and solve problems, I aim to grow as a developer and expand my knowledge in various programming concepts and languages.

## Rules

1. Code and solve problems every day for the next 100 days.
2. Each day, commit to working on coding projects or solving problems for at least one hour.
3. Document progress daily by updating the log file.

Continue updating the log file with your daily progress.

## Goals

1. Complete at least one coding project during the 100 days.
2. Solve a variety of coding problems on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces.
3. Improve proficiency in Python, JavaScript, and algorithms.

## Resources

Here are some resources I'll be using during this challenge:

- Online coding platforms (LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces)
- Programming books and tutorials
- Documentation and guides for languages and libraries I'm using

## Acknowledgements
