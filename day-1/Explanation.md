Explanation of the Code:
Initialization:
At the beginning of the loop, the value of flag is set to 0, indicating that the last word hasn't started yet.

Looping through the String Backwards:
The loop iterates through the characters of the string s starting from the end (s.length() - 1) and moving towards the beginning (0).

Ignoring Leading Spaces:
Inside the loop, there's a condition if (flag == 0 && s[i] == ' '). This condition is used to skip leading spaces until the first non-space character is encountered. If flag is 0 (indicating the last word hasn't started yet) and the current character is a space, the continue statement is used to skip this iteration.

Counting Characters of the Last Word:
Once a non-space character is encountered (i.e., when s[i] != ' '), it means the last word has started. At this point, flag is set to 1 to indicate that the last word has started, and n (the count of characters in the last word) is incremented.

Breaking the Loop:
When a space character is encountered after the last word has started (i.e., when s[i] == ' ' and flag is 1), it means we have reached the end of the last word. At this point, the loop can be terminated using the break statement.

Returning the Count:
Finally, the function returns the count n, which represents the length of the last word in the string s.

The flag variable is used solely for the purpose of identifying when the last word has started. Once the last word begins, it remains 1, and its value is not modified thereafter. It's essentially acting as a marker to indicate whether the last word has been encountered yet.
