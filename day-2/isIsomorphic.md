This code is a C++ implementation of a function isIsomorphic that checks if two strings s and t are isomorphic or not. Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t. Each occurrence of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order. All occurrences of one character must be replaced with the same character and no two different characters should be replaced with the same character.

Here's how the code works:

It defines a class Solution with a public method isIsomorphic.

Inside the isIsomorphic method, two vectors ms and mt of size 128 are created. These vectors are used to map characters to their corresponding positions in the strings s and t.

The loop iterates through each character in the strings s and t. For each character at index i, it checks if the mapping of the character in string s differs from the mapping of the character in string t.

If the mappings differ, it means that the characters are not isomorphic, so it returns false.

If the mappings are the same, it updates the mappings for both characters by setting ms[s[i]] = i+1 and mt[t[i]] = i+1.

After iterating through all characters, if no differences are found, it returns true, indicating that the strings are isomorphic.
